            <h2>Figuring out Problems</h2>
            <p>It is very unlikely that you will be able to drive a vehicle for its entire lifespan without running into a major problem. As a mechanic you must rely on some basic skills to figure these problems out so that you will have a general idea of what to fix.</p>
            <h2>Fuel, Air, Fire</h2>
            <p>If an engine stops running, there are three main causes. The vehicle isn't getting enough fuel, air, or there is no spark to create a fire. To successfully get an engine to start again, we must first figure out which of the three required items are missing. If you turn on your key you should be able to hear your fuel pump engage. If you cannot hear this, check wires and fuses going to the fuel pump. If you think fuel is getting to the engine, the next step is to check for sufficient air. To do this, I recommend taking the air filter off. This takes out the factor of having a dirty air filter starving the engine of air. If both fuel and air are getting to the engine, your next step is to figure out if the engine is getting spark. There are no nice ways to test this. The best possible way is to make sure that all spark plug wires or coils are intact. You could try arcing the spark plug wires or coils but this is highly dangerous and is not recommended.</p>
            <h2>The Mechanic's Senses</h2>
            <p>A major part about being a mechanic is being able to tell what is wrong with a vehicle by what you can hear, see, smell, and feel. Your body's natural senses usually never steer you wrong. You will found out that the more you figure problems out, the easier it is for you to pick up on the sounds and feel of what caused it. Your sense will be your natural ally in working with vehicles. If you smell something rancid or something burning coming through your ventilation system, that means something is burning somewhere. If this happens, calmly stop when it is safe to do so and check your fluids (except your coolant, checking a coolant while hot will lead to injury.) If you start your engine and hear just loud knocking and metalic sounds that weren't there before, be very cautious to shut off the engine before permanent harm can be done. Your senses are the easiest way for you to identify something is wrong with your vehicle. <strong>Do not ignore them!</strong></p>
