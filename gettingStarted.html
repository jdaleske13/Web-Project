            <h2>Getting Started</h2>
            <p>To get started, we must first understand what some basic upkeeps that must be done to your vehicle. To upkeep a vehicle, there are three main factors you have to take into consideration.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>If your vehicle is running nice, you must have nice tires on it to keep it moving.</li>
                <li>If your vehicle seems to be running a little abnormal, always check the easy stuff first.</li>
                <li>Always make sure to keep up with maintenance by changing the filters in your vehicle.</li>
            </ol>
            <h2>Tires</h2>
            <p>Tires are one of the most essential parts of a vehicle. If you don't have tires, you aren't going anywhere. Below is an easy way to tell if your tires are due to be changed. If you can see the top of Abe Lincoln's head, it is time to change your tire.</p>

            <h2>Fluids</h2>
            <p>If for some reason your car starts showing symptons of running hotter than usual, sluggish idle, hard to turn, hard to brake, then it is time to check the fluids. It's hard to exactly say where each dipstick and other utilities are to check a vehicle's fluids becuase they <strong>are not</strong> exactly the same across each vehicle. To get a reasonable idea where to check your fluids, refer to your owner's manual usually located in the glove box of your vehicle.</p>
            <h2>Filters</h2>
            <p>At very specific points in the life of a vehicle (usually every 3,000 to 5,000 miles) the filters on a vehicle must be changed to keep it running smoothly and to not cause damage to the engine. There are two main filters that you must always change, the <strong>oil filter</strong> and the <strong>air filter</strong>. Not having clean oil can significantly damage your engine, and having a dirty air filter can cause extra strain on your engine as well. Below are examples of an oil and air filter.</p>
