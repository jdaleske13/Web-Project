            <h2>"Essential" Tools</h2>
            <p>Since I have worked on vehicles since I was about 13, I can honestly tell you that there is no correct tool. A lot of bolts are universal, but that doesn't mean the tools you have will work. The essential tools that you really need are your muscles. Your brain and your arms are the best muscles that you can use when working on vehicles. Be smart, get a universal tool kit with both metric and standard wrenches and sockets. Sometimes you will find a socket that almost works but is still too loose, if thats the case go down one socket size or switch your measurement to something close to the socket/wrench you are using. Having tools isn't always the magic card that will make you a mechanic. There will be bolts that do not have a good place to reach. This is where your brain comes into play. Look to see if there is openings in a different location that allow you to reach the bolt. Worst case google to see if someone has a better way to reach the bolt you are trying to get to. Above all, to work on vehicles, you must realize you will usually be under prepared for the task. Take the time to get comfortable with what you are working on. Go slow and try to save as many bolts and tools as you can. Most of all remember that there are more tools out there that work better or are specially made for certain vehicles. Try to use these tools as much as you can and remember keep a 10mm close to you.</p>
